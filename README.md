# Evaluation of Modern Large Language Models and Advanced Frameworks for Intent-Based NFV Configuration

This project focuses on evaluating modern large language models (LLMs) and advanced frameworks for intent-based configuration in Network Function Virtualization (NFV). The goal is to analyze the impact of these technologies in simplifying and improving the configuration process for virtualized network functions.

## Context

This work is part of the *Network and Service Management* course at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). It aims to explore the application of advanced technologies in automating and optimizing NFV configurations.

## Objectives

- Evaluate the performance of modern LLMs, such as GPT-4 and Claude Sonnet, in translating high-level intents into low-level NFV configurations.
- Compare the use of innovative frameworks, such as LangChain or LangGraph, to traditional prompt-engineering-based approaches.
- Analyze improvements in accuracy, consistency, and processing speed achieved through these methods.

## Project Structure

The project will consist of the following components:
- **Dataset Creation**: A semi-automated process for generating intent-configuration pairs for NFV scenarios.
- **Framework Implementation**: Development of an intelligent agent to interact with LLMs using structured frameworks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessment of results based on processing time, accuracy, and other key metrics.

## Repository Contents

- **/data**: Contains the dataset of intent-configuration pairs.
- **/framework**: Includes the implementation of the advanced framework used for intent translation.
- **/scripts**: Scripts for preprocessing, testing, and evaluating results.
- **/docs**: Documentation for understanding and reproducing the results.
